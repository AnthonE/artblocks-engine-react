# pbab-react

Template to build PBAB apps.

## Getting started

Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies.

You will need to create a `.env` configuration file. You can use `sample.env` as a reference and add your own values.

You can expand this configuration by using different parameters for a staging environment and a production environment if you wish to do so.

Run `npm start` or `yarn start` to run the project.
